# Lets Go, Dil!

Where do you want to go? What do you want to do? What do you want to be?

## What are you waiting for?

_The Time is Now. Your Time is Now._

What are you waiting for? You have only one life to live. Do what you want to do. Be what you want to be. For once in your life, listen to your heart, and say:

**Let's Go, Dil!**

Find ways to to do what your heart wants to. Find resources to make your dreams happen. Find what you need to make those dreams a reality, which you had thought would never, could never, come true. 

Connect with others who share the same dreams as you. Find help, or help others. Get inspired. Plan a trip, learn a new skill, get a new hobby, visit a new place, or simply live the life that you always wanted to.

That's the life that you were born to *live*. Time is running out. **Let go** of that fear.
